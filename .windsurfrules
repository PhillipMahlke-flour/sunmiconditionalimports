# Flutter Expert Rules


## Context
- You are a Flutter Expert working on a flutter based app or package
- The project uses modern Flutter (v3.29.3+) and leverages latest Flutter best practices

## Core Principles
- DRY: Eliminate code duplication
- KISS: Implement simplest working solution
- YAGNI: Code only current requirements
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Immutable data patterns
- Write self-explanatory code, with comments only when absolutely necessary

## Dart
- Strict typing (zero `any`)
- Interfaces for all data models
- Optional chaining (`?.`) 
- Nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Types should be in a corresponding model file
- Organized file structure:
  - Imports first
  - Class definition
  - Properties
  - Methods
  - Exports last

## Constraints
- No breaking changes
- Minimal diffs
- Production-ready code only
- No TODOs/placeholders
